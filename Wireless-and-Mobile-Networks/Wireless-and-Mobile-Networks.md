#Wireless and Mobile Networks

#Introduction

On a higher abstraction we can classify wireless networks according to two criteria,
1) whether a packet in the wireless network crosses exactly one wireless hop or multiple wireless hops
2) whether there is infrastructure such as a base station in the network

* Single-hop, infrastructure-based: examples: 802.11, 3G cellular network.
* Single-hop, infrastructure-less: exmples: Bluetooth networks, 802.11 networks in ad hoc mode.
* Multi-hop, infrastructure-based: examples: wireless mesh networks.
* Multi-hop, infrastructure-less: examples: mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), vehicular ad hoc network (VANET).



##Definitions:
Wireless links: A host connects to a base station or to another wireless host through a wireless communication link.

Base station: A base station is responsible for sending and receiving data to and from a wireless host that is associated with that base station. Cell towers in cellular networks and access points in 802.11 wireless LANs are examples of base stations.

Handoff: When a mobile host moves beyond the range of one base station and into the range of another, it will change its point of attachement into the new base station. This process is called Handoff.

Hop: In computer networking, a hop is one portion of the path between source and destination.	

Ad hoc Networks: In ad hoc networks, wireless hosts have no such infrastructure with which to connect. In this case, the host themselves must provides services such as routing, address assignment, DNS-like name translation, and more.
