#Beginners Manual for Wireless and Mobile Networks

Analogy with Wired Ethernet: If we replace the wired Ethernet with a wireless 802.11 network, a wireless network interface would replace the hostâ€™s wired Ethernet interface, and an access point would replace the Ethernet switch, but virtually no changes would be needed at the net-
work layer or above. There are important differences between the link layers in both. 

Wireless networks are more error-prone than wired networks.

Wi-Fi : Wireless fidelity
Wireless standards and its variations collectively known as IEEE 802.11
Wifi Alliance is a non-profit organisation that certifies the interoperability of wireless devices built around the 802.11 standard.
